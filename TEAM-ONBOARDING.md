## 📤 UPLOADING ASSETS

### Best Practices for File Names
❌ **BAD:** `IMG_1234.jpg`, `Copy of design.png`, `final-FINAL-v3.jpg`
✅ **GOOD:** `hero-meauxbility-homepage-2025.jpg`, `don-wheelchair-campaign-instagram.png`

**Naming Format:** `[content-type]-[brand]-[purpose]-[date].extension`

Examples:
- `hero-meauxbility-website-nov2025.jpg`
- `social-inneranimals-product-launch.png`
- `thumbnail-youtube-accessibility-guide.jpg`
- `logo-meauxbility-horizontal-white.svg`

### How to Upload

**Method 1: Drag & Drop**
1. Navigate to **Upload Assets** in sidebar
2. Drag files from your computer directly into the upload zone
3. Select brand destination (Meauxbility, Inner Animals, or iAutodidact)
4. Wait for optimization to complete (auto-converts to WebP)
5. Done! Asset is now in your library

**Method 2: Browse Files**
1. Click "Browse Files" button
2. Select multiple files (Cmd+Click or Ctrl+Click)
3. Choose brand
4. Upload

### What Happens During Upload?
- ✅ Auto-resized to max 1920px width (maintains aspect ratio)
- ✅ Converted to WebP format (85% quality, ~70-80% smaller file size)
- ✅ Stripped of EXIF data (privacy + smaller size)
- ✅ Uploaded to Cloudflare R2 cloud storage
- ✅ CDN URL generated for instant access
- ✅ Saved to Asset Library with searchable metadata

**Optimization Example:**
- Original: `sam-pikes-peak.jpg` (4.2 MB)
- Optimized: `sam-pikes-peak.webp` (847 KB) → **80% savings!**

### File Type Support
- **Images:** JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, HEIC
- **Videos:** MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM
- **Documents:** PDF

**Size Limits:**
- Images: 50 MB max
- Videos: 500 MB max

## 🏷️ ORGANIZING ASSETS

### Tagging System
Always add tags when uploading! This makes finding assets later super easy.

**Tag Categories:**
1. **Brand:** meauxbility, inneranimals, iautodidact
2. **Content Type:** hero, social, product, campaign, logo, team
3. **Campaign:** wheelchair-campaign, don-michael, grant-2025
4. **Platform:** instagram, website, youtube, facebook
5. **Color Scheme:** dark-mode, light-mode, gradient

**Example Tags for One Image:**
`meauxbility, hero, website, wheelchair-campaign, gradient, homepage`

### Folder Structure (Auto-Organized)
Assets are automatically sorted by brand and date:
```
/meauxbility/images/2025/11/hero-homepage.webp
/inneranimals/images/2025/11/product-photo.webp
/iautodidact/videos/2025/11/course-intro.mp4
```

### Search & Filter
**In Asset Library:**
- **Search Bar:** Type filename, tags, or description
- **Brand Filter:** Show only Meauxbility assets
- **Type Filter:** Show only images/videos/documents
- **Date Filter:** Show last 30 days, last quarter, etc.

**Pro Tip:** Use multiple filters together!
Example: Brand=Meauxbility + Type=Images + Tags contains "campaign"
